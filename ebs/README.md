# Amazon Elastic Block Store

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances.
Amazon EBS Snapshots are an easy way to backup data stored on an Amazon EBS Volume. If the volume fails, or data is accidentally deleted, the snapshot can be used to create a new volume. Therefore, it is advisable to frequently take a snapshot of important volumes.
