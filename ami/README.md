# Amazon Machine Images
Amazon EC2 provides templates known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that contain a software configuration (for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications). You use these templates to launch an instance, which is a copy of the AMI running as a virtual server in the cloud.
